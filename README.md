Let's make this absolutely clear. Russia Invaded Crimea, where the world did nothing, then
Russia again Invaded Ukraine.

If you support Russia's efforts in Ukraine, you can fuck off. I don't care where you come from,
what your nationality, religion, etc. is, you can fuck off. No, for real. YOU DO NOT GET A LICENSE
IF YOU AGREE WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.

Let's make this absolutely clear. Israel is in the process of engaging in the genocide of the
Palestinian people, and have been since before I was born. If you support the continued actions of
Israel in Gaza, you can fuck off. I don't care where you come from, what your nationality, religion,
etc. is, you can fuck off. No, for real. YOU DO NOT GET A LICENSE IF YOU AGREE WITH THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT. Hamas doesn't get a pass in their actions, but they aren't a government elected by
people.
